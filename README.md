Displays the list of formatted event data

## How to run on local

```

    $ yarn

    $ yarn start

```

## TODO

Line 14 in `Text.module.css`: To show the second line without changing the height on hover. But this will break the rule in the description.

Another option I have is to use the tooltip component, and if the user hover over the wallet address or some important content, then we can let him copy it by using [react-copy-to-clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-copy-to-clipboard).
